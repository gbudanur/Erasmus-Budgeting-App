# Erasmus Budgeting App / Erasmus Bütçe Planlama Uygulaması

This is a basic budget planning app developed to be used by semester abroad (Erasmus) students. Since I started this project with a momentary  fad and don't have the motivation to perfect it, it might include basic bugs. In order to avoid most of them I would suggest being careful with the inputs. ***Please do review the code before using it.***

## Features

### • Get monthly budget expectations

Set your planned monthly income (scholarship, allowance) and spending (rent, monthly subscriptions) from relevant options as well as your remaining duration of mobility (from "Settings") at the beginning of a month and receive monthly budget expectations. _(Math behind it might need an update, use it with caution)_

### • Plan your trips!

From "Travel Planning", set a name for your trip and determine the budget for it. Withdraw money as you spend it.
